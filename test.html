[10:32:30] <Sha`Bren> isharacomix_lab: Attempting a takeover of the local LUGs, I see ;)
[10:32:45] <IsharaComix> My plan is falling into place.
[10:32:45] <lessthanthree> MY PLAN FOR ONLY $5.95 A MINUTE I HAVE TO KEEP BREATHING PROPERLY
[10:32:49] <IsharaComix> *evil laugh*
[10:33:12] <IsharaComix> The talk last night was really awesome.
[10:33:15] <IsharaComix> You guys missed out.
[10:34:08] <Sha`Bren> Haha. I meant to come, but forgot it was last night :(
[10:34:33] <Sha`Bren> I've got all my systems set up with IPv6 using HE now.
[10:35:12] <IsharaComix> Nice. We had a different talk setup, where we had a primary speaker talk about IPv6, and then three speakers give a ten minute blurb about "I did *this* with IPv6 lately".
[10:35:36] <IsharaComix> There was lots of engagement and lots of energy.
[10:35:51] <IsharaComix> LOUDBOT, are you IPv6-ready?
[10:35:51] <LOUDBOT> IsharaComix: I PICTURED ROUGH UNFINISHED TREE LIMBS
[10:35:52] <lessthanthree> TILL SUNDAY MOTHERFUCKER
[10:41:00] <mdwright> LOUDBOT is WEBSCALE
[10:41:14] <spiffytech> IsharaComix: Did they follow the tradition of proclaiming the end of NAT without solving scanning a network for printers and LAN-private services, etc.?
[10:41:30] <IsharaComix> Yes! :D
[10:42:00] <IsharaComix> IPv6 - the infrastructure is ready, but the assumptions from application developers are what's causing the problems.
[10:42:00] <lessthanthree> CREATED EQUAL. BUT SOME ARE MORE NERVE ENDINGS IN THE DECRIPTION
[10:42:50] <spiffytech> Without NAT, how do I restrict a service to only machines in my office without resorting to IP whitelists?
[10:42:56] <Sha`Bren> For LAN-private stuff, isn't it just a matter of having the device reject connections from anything other than the local subnet?
[10:42:56] <lessthanthree>  GRETCHEN IS THE DUDE.
[10:43:02] <barik> Freeh is on sabbatical next year? I assumed he was already on sabbitical for the past 2 years based on his classes....
[10:43:15] <IsharaComix> Sha`Bren: Right.
[10:43:23] <IsharaComix> NAT was never meant to be used for security.
[10:43:40] <mdwright> @barik++
[10:43:40] <IsharaComix> But people say "NAT will make my private devices inaccessible to the public interwebs!"
[10:44:05] <spiffytech> So every machine needs it's own firewall rules specifying that?
[10:44:06] <IsharaComix> So they use NAT because it's easier than proper firewalls/iptables/etc
[10:44:39] <IsharaComix> spiffytech: No. You can also define firewall rules at the edge of the network.
[10:45:04] <IsharaComix> for example, all machines in NCSU's network are publicly addressable.
[10:45:13] <IsharaComix> (i think, my brother can access them anyway)
[10:45:41] <spiffytech> Yeah, they're public
[10:45:41] <lessthanthree> TURTLE UNDER A GAG BALL?
[10:45:48] <IsharaComix> But you can still filter inbound traffics at the entry point.
[10:46:12] <IsharaComix> NAT was never meant to be used for security. When you dance on the broken glass of undefined behavior, you're bound to cut your feet.
[10:46:30] <Sha`Bren> If you want a NAT-like setup, I imagine you could just default all incoming traffic to DENY.
[10:46:39] <Sha`Bren> And add exceptions as necessary
[10:46:58] <spiffytech> Doesn't sound too bad.
[10:47:17] <IsharaComix> Indeed.
[10:50:57] <barik> Are there any ISPs now that are actually handing down IPv6 addresses to home customers?
[10:51:29] <IsharaComix> Apparently comcast is.
[10:51:35] <barik> I've seen lots of "we plan on transitioning" statements.
[10:51:36] <IsharaComix> But AT&T is like "LOLNOPE"
[10:51:39] <barik> Ah.. so Comcast actually is already?
[10:51:53] <IsharaComix> Some folks have reported getting in on a beta test with comcast.
[10:52:02] <Sha`Bren> And TWC plans to have >1% of their customers on IPv6 by June -- we'll see how that goes
[10:52:13] <IsharaComix> Also verizon *I THINK* is doing an open beta of IPv6 on mobile.
[10:52:17] <IsharaComix> not open open
[10:52:19] <IsharaComix> but you know what i mean
[10:52:22] <IsharaComix> they're testing it
[10:52:58] <barik> Is the short term (heh, long term?) plan for all the ISPs to do dual-stack and hand out both IPv6 and ipV4 addresses?
[10:54:23] <Sha`Bren> That's TWC's plan, at least for the moment -- they'll be assigning /64's by default, and /56's on request
[10:55:03] <spiffytech> The local subnet for IPv6 is 64 bits, yes?
[10:55:03] <lessthanthree> THE LOCAL GAME SHOP
[10:55:11] <Sha`Bren> spiffytech: Yup
[10:55:27] <spiffytech> Is it reasonable to expect computers to scan that many addresses for printers?
[10:55:41] <Sha`Bren> spiffytech: Hah. Point
[10:56:06] <Sha`Bren> That's how many duodecillion?
[10:56:12] <IsharaComix> Yeah. nmapping is hard in ipv6. :P
[10:56:26] <spiffytech> We'll probably have to reengineer things as broadcast protocols a la ARP instead of scanning prototols. 
[10:56:38] <IsharaComix> Yes.
[10:56:57] <spiffytech> It'll be an interesting change
[10:57:00] <mdwright> spiffytech: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol
[10:58:13] <spiffytech> I'm sad they didn't extend the max TTL it IPv6. The Internet is narrow now, but I'm pretty sure once we start colonizing other planets we're never moving off of IPv6, and a max TTL of 256 might be a problem for interstellar relays.
[10:58:15] <barik> My networking is weak, but I already thought some printer discovery protocols were already through broadcast packets or some form?
[10:58:57] <barik> Although, now that I think about it, I have no idea how my printer gets discovered. :)
[10:59:05] <mdwright> barik: black magick
[10:59:09] *** Quits: CarsonLynn1 (~carson@cpe-065-190-203-216.nc.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[10:59:25] <barik> mdwright: For me, effectively, yes it's mostly magick.
[10:59:37] <barik> twiddle my thumbs.. oh there it is
[11:01:41] <mdwright> My mac can tell when I'm on a network that has a landing page that requires me to login/accept whatever agreement and will automatically open up that page in a new window.
[11:02:05] <barik> mdwright: Looking at my phone, it's sort of weird though... it seems like it tries to connect to apple.com first.
[11:02:08] <mdwright> I have some guesses as to how they do it, but I'm going to continue considering it black magic
[11:02:09] <Sha`Bren> mdwright: I've been wondering how that works? Does it just ping apple.com and see if something gets in the way?
[11:02:13] <barik> mdwright: And if that fails, assumes it's a login page.
[11:03:23] <mdwright> Sha`Bren: Yeah, my guess is they have a blank page set up that they grab, and if it isn't empty loads the content in a little webview
[11:04:04] <mdwright> you can't do it on a failure to reach apple.com, because the network may not have internet access (and thus you don't want to open the webview)
[11:04:25] <barik> Fair enough.
[11:04:47] <Sha`Bren> Ah, seems reasonable. Handy too.
[11:06:00] <mdwright> google serves up a couple blank pages for reasons like this, but I can't remember where they are
